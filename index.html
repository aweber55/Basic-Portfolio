    <p>A little bit about myself. I was born in Indiana back when Earth Wind and Fire were on the Billboard 
        top ten list for their song "Shining Star", even though that has absolutely nothing to do with my Bio at all.
          As expected, I do not remember much about that time in my life. Shortly after that my family decided to move to Florida.
        </p>
    <p>After High school, I went on to college where I studied Anthropology and Agricultural Business Management.
             Upon realizing that the job of Indiana Jones was already taken, with little to no chance of that spot opening up,
              I realized a major in Anthropology might not have been my wisest decision.
        </p>
    <p>I then decided to make a move, and ended up in Idaho. Working in a large steakhouse doing everything 
        from dishwasher to bartender, I decided to learn how to cook. A couple of years late I landed a head Chef job.
        </p> 
    <p>Then, after all that time, I reconnected with my college sweetheart, and we got married at the courthouse in
             Orlando. So, I quit my job, sold my house, and came back to Florida. 
                Now, the journey continues.
